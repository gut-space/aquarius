The goal of this project is to build a fully functional automated VHF satellite ground station, loosely based on [satnogs](https://satnogs.org) project.

Project founders: [SÅ‚awek Figiel](https://github.com/fivitti) and [Tomek Mrugalski](https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/)

# Project status

As of Jan 2021, the following features are working:

- WiMo TA-1 antenna, SDR and RPi4 are working
- Automated reception and transmission decoding for NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 satellites (APT)
- Support for Meteor M2 transmissions (LRPT)
- Transmissions are decoded and uploaded automatically to our content server (see https://aquarius.klub.com.pl)
- Automated updates for the server
- Orbital TLE data is recorded
- Pass over charts (azimuth/elevation)

Work in progress and plans for the next couple weeks:

- user management
- automated updates for the station
- quality assessment for decoded images
- georeferencing

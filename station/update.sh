# there is only 0 or 1 possible. However, in developer case, there may be local changes.
# We don't want to throw them away, but at the same time we want to get any updates that
# may be available on the server. As such, we're stashing local changes. Those can be
# reinstated (git stash pop) or discarded (git stash drop). It's possible to stash multiple
# layers, so this mechanism is safe in principle.
